# 100hrs-NodeJs-Express-MySQL-MongoDB-RESTful-Graphql-Websocket

This repository contains three projects that showcase my learning journey through Node.js, backend development, and full-stack integrations. Each project reflects different aspects of web development, from core server setups to advanced database management, real-time communication, and secure authentication.

## What I Learned

### Core Node.js Fundamentals
- **Node.js Core**: Explored the core modules of Node.js, such as `fs`, `http`, and `path`, understanding their use and behavior.
- **View Engine**: Integrated templating engines like EJS to render dynamic HTML, keeping server-side code modular and reusable.
- **MVC Pattern**: Implemented the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern for a cleaner, more maintainable code structure.

### Authentication & Security
- **Sessions & Cookies**: Managed user sessions and cookies to create stateful user experiences.
- **JWT Authentication**: Configured JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure and stateless user authentication, critical for modern REST APIs.

### Database Management
- **MySQL & Sequelize**: Learned SQL fundamentals and used Sequelize ORM to interact with MySQL databases, building models and associations efficiently.
- **MongoDB & Mongoose**: Gained proficiency with MongoDB for NoSQL data management and Mongoose for schema-based models, exploring document-oriented storage.

### API Development
- **RESTful APIs**: Built RESTful API endpoints using Express, focusing on CRUD operations, routing, and middleware for streamlined and scalable APIs.
- **GraphQL**: Integrated GraphQL to create flexible and efficient queries, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data, enhancing API performance.

### Real-Time Communication
- **WebSockets / Socket.IO**: Used WebSocket and Socket.IO to enable real-time, bidirectional communication for chat applications and notifications.

### Data Validation & Error Handling
- **Input Validation**: Ensured data integrity with strong validation practices for user input, implementing libraries like Joi.
- **Error Handling**: Designed robust error-handling mechanisms to catch and process errors gracefully, enhancing user experience and debugging.

### Payments Integration
- **Stripe API**: Integrated Stripeâ€™s payment processing API to manage secure transactions, exploring best practices for implementing payment gateways.

### Security & SSL Configuration
- **SSL/TLS Configuration**: Set up SSL/TLS for secure HTTP connections, learning the basics of certificates, private keys, and HTTPS.

### Testing & Validation
- **Chai.js**: Used Chai.js for unit and integration testing, improving code quality and reliability.

### Build Tools & Package Management
- **NPM & Build Tools**: Explored essential Node.js tools and packages, including npm scripts and build automation for an efficient development workflow.

### Modern JavaScript & TypeScript
- **TypeScript**: Integrated TypeScript for type safety and cleaner code, learning static typing, interfaces, and modules in JavaScript projects.
- **Deno**: Experimented with Deno as an alternative to Node.js, exploring its built-in security, dependency management, and TypeScript support.
